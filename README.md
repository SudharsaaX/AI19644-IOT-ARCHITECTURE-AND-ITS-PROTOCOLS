## 🌐 Overview

This repository contains lab experiments for the **IoT Architecture and Its Protocols** course. These experiments aim to provide a hands-on understanding of IoT fundamentals, communication models, architecture patterns, and widely used protocols in IoT systems.

All experiments are written using **Arduino (.ino)** files for NodeMCU and tested using tools like **Mosquitto** and **MQTT Explorer**.
